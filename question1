Question
The function def differenceofSum(n. m) accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

Assumption:

n>0 and m>0
Sum lies between integral range
Example

Input
n:4
m:20
Output
90

Explanation

Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
Difference 150 â€“ 60 = 90
Sample Input
n:3
m:10
Sample Output
19


Code:-
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Write C code here
   int m;
   int n;
   int sum1=0;
   int sum2=0;
   scanf("%d",&n);
   scanf("%d",&m);
   for(int i=0;i<=m;i++)
   {
       if(i%n==0)
       
           sum1+=i;
        else
            sum2+=i;
      
   }
   printf("%d",(sum1-sum2));

    
}

output:-
-------
enter num1:1
enter num2:20
difference is 210.
